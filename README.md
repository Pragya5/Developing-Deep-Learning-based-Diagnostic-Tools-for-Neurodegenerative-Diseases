# Developing-Deep-Learning-based-Diagnostic-Tools-for-Neurodegenerative-Diseases
Neurodegenerative diseases pose a significant burden on the healthcare systems, making research aimed at developing techniques
for the early diagnosis of such pathologies, of utmost importance.
Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a prominent example with millions of
patients affected globally. The detection of the biomarkers of AD
that mark its early progression has been known to aid researchers
in devising notable treatment regimens and testing their efficacy.
Advancements in non-invasive MRI techniques may facilitate the
identification of the biomarkers that are critical for the accurate
diagnosis of AD. Multivariate pattern analysis has been a go-to strategy to effectively analyze neuroimaging data by adopting machine
learning algorithms that extract information from multiple points
in the images without prior knowledge of the points encoding this
information.
